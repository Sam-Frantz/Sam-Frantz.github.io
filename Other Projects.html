        <p>
            Farside coffee was a project I had started to create a tangible space to explore
            more within ourselves and each other. This project focused on delayed gratification,
            in a culture of instant gratification through social media, to-go everything, and 
            a growing focus on the self image rather than the self. The project housed some
            physical encounters with delayed gratification, such as the interactive Faraday room,
            where cell phone signals were not able to pass, highlighting the communication with
            others and self in person rather than digitally catered social circles. But the most
            influential piece of the project was the physical space and presence of myself there.
            People were at the core of the project, and a need to gather people around the 
            project rather than spearheading will be needed for any future project of the nature.

            Instead of thinking about music in terms of genre or era, I have begun to think of 
            each piece in terms of color. I deleted all of my playlists based on genre and started
            constructing colored playlists. By thinking about music this way, a song by Bob Dylan
            can blend with sounds of Aquilo and other atypical pairings to give new life to how we
            listen and appreciate music. Songs are separated into colors based mainly off of 
            instinct, but a minor tie to the natural occurrence of the color is nodded to in a 
            brief description included in the each playlist. The pieces are intended to be listened
            to on shuffle and will enhance the variation and scope of the listening experience, 
            but the current song order is not methodical. The aim of this project is to use ~20 
            different colors, seasonally rotating in 6-color palettes, each containing over 100 
            songs, in order to listen to and select music in a different way. I am currently 
            searching for a better way to discover music without selection bias so that I can 
            extend past genre.
